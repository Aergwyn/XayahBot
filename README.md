# Xayah Bot
Xayah Bot is a Discord Bot intended to use for either fun interactions, some management on roles and access to the Riot Games API. A detailed list of commands will follow later on.

This project is comepletey written in C# and references the following frameworks:
- Microsoft Entity Framework Core
- Discord.Net - [Link](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net)

I try to write as much as possible myself to learn and try different approaches. I welcome any suggestions and feedback (see Contact).

## Features
As already mentioned there are essentially three categories of commands.
1. Fun commands: something like the 8-ball command ~~or a quiz~~.
2. Informational commands: Retrieving data about a champion or notifying about incidents currently ongoing all fueled by Riot Games API
3. Organisational commands: Excluding users/channels from certain commands to reduce spam or letting XayahBot track your Rank in League and assign corresponding roles

## Usage
Each command is able to be used by prefixing a message with a `.` and then using command syntax. It is also possible to mention Xayah Bot instead.
Examples:
> .help
> @Xayah Bot help

Following is a list of all commands. If I learn something new I may rework them to be easier to use or more efficient so they are all subject to change. I'll try to keep this list as up to date as possible.

###### Help
Usable by: Everyone
Usable in: Guilds, DMs and Groups
Description: The help shows you which commands exist and how to use them. Also contains my contact data. As there are just too many commands to list them flat out they are categorized and you will have to follow up that command with the desired category.
