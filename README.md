# Xayah Bot
`Xayah Bot` is a Discord Bot intended to use for giving League of Legends statistics (general data about champs, winrates, banrates, etc.). Additionally there are other useful commands which you can see [here](https://github.com/Aergwyn/XayahBot#commands).

This project is comepletey written in C# and references the following frameworks:
- Microsoft Entity Framework Core
- Discord.Net - [Link](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net)

To present data `Xayah Bot` will access the following APIs:
- Riot Games API
- Champion.GG API

I try to write as much as possible myself to learn and try different approaches. I welcome any feedback (see [Contact](https://github.com/Aergwyn/XayahBot#contact).
